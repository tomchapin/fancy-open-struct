0.2.0
  - Replaced the display_recursive_open_hash method with functionality from the awesome_print gem.
    Note: This fundamentally changes the way how this method operates, and is not backwards compatible.
  - Aliased the display_recursive_open_hash method to the debug_inspect method.
  - Changed method_missing so that it is private

0.1.6
  - This version is a complete drop-in replacement for RecursiveOpenStruct (v 0.4.5) with all of the
    passing tests from RecursiveOpenStruct, and all of the methods (including debugging methods).
